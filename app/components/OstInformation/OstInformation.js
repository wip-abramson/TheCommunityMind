    <h1>What is Inspiration?</h1>
    <p>Inspiration is a token minted using Simple Token</p>
    <p>The idea behind including a token in The Community Mind is to incentivise good questions an remove bad ones</p>
    <p>I hope to create a micro economy where the best questions rise to the top and the best questioners are rewarded</p>
    <p><a href="https://ost.com/" target="_blank">Simple Token</a> allows The Community Mind to achieve this easily without much additional work</p>
    <p>I am still figuring out how the token mechanics will work</p>

    <p>Currently you pay to ask a question. An investment which you can hopefully earn rewards on.
      You recieve money back for every person that likes or "ponders" your question</p>
    <p>Eventually I hope to have bounties behind every topic that increase as people ask questions against them and approve links between
    questions and topics. These bounties will be paid out regularly to the top questions in that topic.</p>
    <h2>Dont care about blockchain. Just ask some questions the tokens currently have no value as its a Proof of Concept!</h2>
